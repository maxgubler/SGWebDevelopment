                    <p>Put it in, leave it alone. Here we're limited by the time we have. <strong>Don't fiddle with it all day.</strong> Brown is such a nice color. You can create anything that makes you happy. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. Fluff that up. Let your imagination be your guide.</p>
                    <p>Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. <strong>Put your feelings into it</strong>, your heart, it's your world. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. Just beat the devil out of it. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction.</p>
                    <p>Let your <a href="#hobbies">hobbies</a> guide you!</p>
